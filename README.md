# Python Advent of Code - PyAVC 2023

This repository contains my solutions in Python for the puzzles of [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/).

Please, contact me if you have any comments or suggestions for the proposed solutions.

### Personal commments

* **Day 1**: The first part was easy, the second harder (I failed twice). It was unclear whether the string `'eightwo'` should be converted into 88 or 82 (and it was the second).
* **Day 2**: Easy with dictionaries, both first and second part. Implemented in functional syle (with `map`, `reduce`, and `sum`).

### Other languages

* [Pietroppeter](https://github.com/pietroppeter/adventofcode2023) is publishing solutions in [NIM](https://nim-lang.org/) and [Gleam](https://gleam.io/)
